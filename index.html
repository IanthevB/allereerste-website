  On first glance, it appears to be just a simple stone, a pretty stone, yes, but not worth hours or maybe even minutes of your attention. This goes for many other inscriptions of the ancient Greek world which are often overlooked by the public. This kind of epigraphical evidence however is one of our most valuable sources for historical research.
  It is nevertheless the stone-cold truth that these kinds of inscriptions do not have the same ´sex-appeal´ as large monuments, statues or works of art. It doesn’t have the same kind of decorative reliefs or images like some grave stones, or the amazing grandeur of some colossal statues, down the hall of the exact same museum.
  Moreover, the ancient language written on these marbles, makes it very difficult for a foreign tourist who cannot read ancient Greek, to understand the engravings.
  This makes the informative value of the marble (and its beauty as well) less accessible, which is a terrible shame considering the historical importance this stone has for understanding, illuminating and analyzing the past.

<p>
    Therefore, right here and now, let's not do this. Let us not be rash and stand still for a moment, to read, understand and gaze at this stone. So that we can uncover its mysteries.
</p>

<p>
    And so, we meet Pytheas: and ordinary, loyal citizen of Athens. He will tell us more about the ancient world, democracy, honors, ancient spa's and the importance of water management.

    So are you ready to meet Pytheas and explore his life and the ancient world?
    Then click the ancient Greek guy, and we shall take a quick look into his life!
