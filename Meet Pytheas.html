<center> <h2> Let's meet the man: A brief introduction </h2> </center>

<p>
Pytheas was an ambitious and loyal citizen of the ancient Greek world.
He was however also an ordinary, almost forgettable man and nowadays not many people have heard of him.
Nevertheless his presence has offered us much insight into Greek antiquity. He should therefore not be forgotten.
First, let me tell you a little bit more about our main character: Pytheas of Alopeke.
Pytheas lived near the end of the fourth century BC. On an inscription, our hardworking Pytheas is being honored for
his outstanding work for the Amphiareion, an ancient Spa and healing sanctuary close to Athens.
He took care of the water supply and added several fountains and sewers to the landscape of the famous sanctuary.
He updated the spaâ€™s water facilities, for which he received a considerable amount of money and a gorgeous crown.
His actions and rewards are all mentioned on a large piece of marble.
This rock was found in the middle of the Amphiareion sanctuary at the end of the nineteenth century by a group of archaeologists,
after which it was transported to a museum.
